Script 1 : the data shows how codes as been generated by using python and a graph came out as output after running the cells, it can be seen that there are historical data for three years for number of email frequency. By generating these codes, it helped us to get a final outcome and it is quite precise data shown on the graph within 12 months of each year accounting from year 2000 to year 2002 and to be noted that it is in 2002 that the company went bankrupt due to fraud.

As written in the case study database of email went public where anyone could download it from the net which made the company bankrupt  and a data schema from Enron was transferred to collab to make it in python language.

script 2 :To be able to find the top emailers of the company data of employees emails and number of email sent by employees and outsiders must be analyse to sort out and find the ones with most emails sent .This can be done by using the data gathered on the question paper where python extracted data are readily available. For example the following piece of code can be used:
SELECT senders,count (mid)As message_count

 FROM message
 GROUP BY SENDER 
 ORDER BY message_count;
 
 SELECT date(date)AS date_sent,count (mid) AS message_count
 FROM message
 GROUP BY date_sent
 GROUP BY date_sent;
